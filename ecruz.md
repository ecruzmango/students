# Project Proposal: Multiplayer Platformer Game

## Summary
The project aims to develop a multiplayer platforming video game. This game will feature character progression, skill development, item collection, and cooperative gameplay. Players will navigate through intricate levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and puzzles, enhancing their character's abilities and equipment over time.

Platforming games are a popular genre, but many titles either lack a multiplayer component or have limited cooperative features. By focusing on both cooperative and competitive play, the game caters to players who enjoy working together as well as those who want competition.

## Major Features
1. **Platforming Mechanics**: The game will feature platforming elements such as jumping, running, wall-climbing, and dodging obstacles. Levels will be designed to challenge players' timing and reflexes.
2. **Multiplayer Modes**: 
   - **Cooperative Mode**: Players can team up to complete levels, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies together
   - **Competitive Mode**: Players can compete against each other in time trials or obstacle courses to see who can complete the level fastest or collect the most items.
3. **Diverse Environments**: The game will include a variety of themed environments, such as forests, volcanos, and futuristic cities, each with different styles and challenges.
4. **Power-Ups and Collectibles**: Players can find power-ups that temporarily enhance their abilities (e.g., double jump, speed boost) and collectibles that can unlock new levels. **Level Design**: A mix of linear and open-ended level design to provide variety and encourage exploration.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: C++ for the core game development, Python for scripting
- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine or pygame, which provide tools for platforming and 
multiplayer integration.
- **Graphics and Art**: pixquare for sprite art, and Spine for 2D character animations.
- **Audio**: FMOD or Wwise for sound effects and music integration.

## Target Audience
- **Friends and Family**: The cooperative mode will appeal to groups looking for shared gaming experiences.
